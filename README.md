## External Extender
What I used to add new controls to the existing controls in GeonBit.UI

## GridSelect
A 2D selector, this is demonstrated in the colorpicker.

## Minor
Some minor changes that either have been done or need further testing/work.

## SliderVertical
Just a vertical version of the existing Slider control, demonstrated again in the colorpicker.

## TitleBar
Allows movement of the entire window similar to the default windows titlebar.
You can safely set "Window.IsBorderless = True" and get a custom look to your game.

### Note
Changes that fix or add more things could happen.
Like improving on the font rendering in the colorpicker.
Monogame.Extended might be require for some bits of the codebase.
Currently only targeting Windows but i would like to have complete platform-indepence at some point.
