## External Extender
What I used to add new controls to the existing controls in GeonBit.UI

## GridSelect
A 2D selector, this is demonstrated in the colorpicker.

## Minor
Some minor changes that either have been done or need further testing/work.

## SliderVertical
Just a vertical version of the existing Slider control, demonstrated again in the colorpicker.

### Note
Changes that fix or add more things could happen.
Like improving on the font rendering in the colorpicker.
